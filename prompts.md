title: Prompts

## Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
arctic_a0001
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
arctic_a0002
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
arctic_a0003
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
arctic_a0004
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Will we ever forget it.
arctic_a0005
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
arctic_a0006
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
arctic_a0007
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Gad, your letter came just in time.
arctic_a0008
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
arctic_a0009
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
arctic_a0010
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
arctic_a0011
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
arctic_a0012
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
arctic_a0013
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
arctic_a0014
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It's the aurora borealis.
arctic_a0015
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
arctic_a0016
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
arctic_a0017
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was a change now.
arctic_a0018
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
arctic_a0019
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
arctic_a0020
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
arctic_a0021
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
arctic_a0022
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
arctic_a0023
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
arctic_a0024
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
arctic_a0025
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
arctic_a0026
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
arctic_a0027
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Robbery, bribery, fraud,
arctic_a0028
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Their forces were already moving into the north country.
arctic_a0029
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I had faith in them.
arctic_a0030
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They were three hundred yards apart.
arctic_a0031
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
arctic_a0032
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
arctic_a0033
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
arctic_a0034
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
arctic_a0035
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She turned in at the hotel.
arctic_a0036
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was the only one who remained sitting.
arctic_a0037
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We'll have to watch our chances.
arctic_a0038
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
arctic_a0039
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
arctic_a0040
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
arctic_a0041
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
arctic_a0042
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
arctic_a0043
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
arctic_a0044
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He moved away as quietly as he had come.
arctic_a0045
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
arctic_a0046
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
arctic_a0047
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
arctic_a0048
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
arctic_a0049
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
arctic_a0050
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
arctic_a0051
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was a curious coincidence.
arctic_a0052
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
arctic_a0053
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was nothing on the rock.
arctic_a0054
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
arctic_a0055
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
arctic_a0056
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I have no idea, replied Philip.
arctic_a0057
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
arctic_a0058
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His immaculate appearance was gone.
arctic_a0059
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Anyway, no one saw her like that.
arctic_a0060
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
arctic_a0061
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The men stared into each other's face.
arctic_a0062
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
arctic_a0063
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
arctic_a0064
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
arctic_a0065
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
arctic_a0066
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
arctic_a0067
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In a flash Philip followed its direction.
arctic_a0068
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
arctic_a0069
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
arctic_a0070
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## What was the object of your little sensation.
arctic_a0071
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But who was Eileen's double.
arctic_a0072
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
arctic_a0073
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
arctic_a0074
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There has been a change, she interrupted him.
arctic_a0075
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
arctic_a0076
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It is the fire, partly, she said.
arctic_a0077
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
arctic_a0078
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was a large canoe.
arctic_a0079
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## What if Jeanne failed him.
arctic_a0080
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## What if she did not come to the rock.
arctic_a0081
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His face was streaming with blood.
arctic_a0082
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
arctic_a0083
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
arctic_a0084
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
arctic_a0085
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Death had come with terrible suddenness.
arctic_a0086
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
arctic_a0087
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
arctic_a0088
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
arctic_a0089
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The singing voice approached rapidly.
arctic_a0090
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
arctic_a0091
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
arctic_a0092
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For a full minute he crouched and listened.
arctic_a0093
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
arctic_a0094
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
arctic_a0095
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
arctic_a0096
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
arctic_a0097
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Shall I carry you.
arctic_a0098
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
arctic_a0099
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You must sleep, he urged.
arctic_a0100
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You, you would not keep the truth from me.
arctic_a0101
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He will follow us soon.
arctic_a0102
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
arctic_a0103
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
arctic_a0104
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
arctic_a0105
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
arctic_a0106
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## If you only could know how I thank you.
arctic_a0107
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
arctic_a0108
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
arctic_a0109
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
arctic_a0110
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
arctic_a0111
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was wounded in the arm.
arctic_a0112
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
arctic_a0113
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
arctic_a0114
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
arctic_a0115
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
arctic_a0116
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
arctic_a0117
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Pierre obeys me when we are together.
arctic_a0118
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
arctic_a0119
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
arctic_a0120
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
arctic_a0121
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
arctic_a0122
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She had died from cold and starvation.
arctic_a0123
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
arctic_a0124
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
arctic_a0125
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Each day she became a more vital part of him.
arctic_a0126
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
arctic_a0127
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
arctic_a0128
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Her face was against his breast.
arctic_a0129
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She was his now, forever.
arctic_a0130
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
arctic_a0131
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
arctic_a0132
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
arctic_a0133
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
arctic_a0134
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
arctic_a0135
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
arctic_a0136
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
arctic_a0137
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
arctic_a0138
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
arctic_a0139
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
arctic_a0140
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
arctic_a0141
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
arctic_a0142
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
arctic_a0143
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
arctic_a0144
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
arctic_a0145
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
arctic_a0146
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
arctic_a0147
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now these things had been struck dead within him.
arctic_a0148
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
arctic_a0149
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
arctic_a0150
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
arctic_a0151
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
arctic_a0152
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
arctic_a0153
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
arctic_a0154
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
arctic_a0155
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
arctic_a0156
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
arctic_a0157
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Does that look good.
arctic_a0158
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
arctic_a0159
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
arctic_a0160
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
arctic_a0161
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
arctic_a0162
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip made no effort to follow.
arctic_a0163
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
arctic_a0164
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
arctic_a0165
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
arctic_a0166
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was near the cabin, and saw you.
arctic_a0167
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
arctic_a0168
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
arctic_a0169
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
arctic_a0170
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
arctic_a0171
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
arctic_a0172
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The date was nearly eighteen years old.
arctic_a0173
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They were the presage of storm.
arctic_a0174
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
arctic_a0175
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
arctic_a0176
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
arctic_a0177
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
arctic_a0178
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
arctic_a0179
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
arctic_a0180
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## So cheer up, and give us your paw.
arctic_a0181
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This time he did not yap for mercy.
arctic_a0182
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And the air was growing chilly.
arctic_a0183
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
arctic_a0184
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
arctic_a0185
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
arctic_a0186
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
arctic_a0187
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
arctic_a0188
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
arctic_a0189
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
arctic_a0190
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
arctic_a0191
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He did not rush in.
arctic_a0192
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was edged with ice.
arctic_a0193
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He drank of the water cautiously.
arctic_a0194
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But a strange thing happened.
arctic_a0195
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
arctic_a0196
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
arctic_a0197
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
arctic_a0198
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
arctic_a0199
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
arctic_a0200
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He cried, and swung the club wildly.
arctic_a0201
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
arctic_a0202
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They were following the shore of a lake.
arctic_a0203
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
arctic_a0204
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## From now on we're pals.
arctic_a0205
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
arctic_a0206
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## How much was it.
arctic_a0207
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
arctic_a0208
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was not a large lake, and almost round.
arctic_a0209
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
arctic_a0210
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
arctic_a0211
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
arctic_a0212
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
arctic_a0213
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
arctic_a0214
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They die out of spite.
arctic_a0215
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
arctic_a0216
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
arctic_a0217
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
arctic_a0218
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
arctic_a0219
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
arctic_a0220
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I don't know why you're here at all.
arctic_a0221
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## What part of the United States is your home.
arctic_a0222
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
arctic_a0223
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
arctic_a0224
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
arctic_a0225
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## That came before my A B C's.
arctic_a0226
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
arctic_a0227
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But it contributed to the smash.
arctic_a0228
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The last one I knew was an overseer.
arctic_a0229
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Do you know any good land around here.
arctic_a0230
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
arctic_a0231
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I cannot follow you, she said.
arctic_a0232
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
arctic_a0233
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
arctic_a0234
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His voice was passionately rebellious.
arctic_a0235
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Don't you see I hate you.
arctic_a0236
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
arctic_a0237
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
arctic_a0238
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
arctic_a0239
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Wash your hands of me.
arctic_a0240
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
arctic_a0241
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I saw it when she rolled.
arctic_a0242
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I only read the quotations.
arctic_a0243
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
arctic_a0244
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
arctic_a0245
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
arctic_a0246
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They ought to pass here some time today.
arctic_a0247
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I had been sad too long already.
arctic_a0248
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
arctic_a0249
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
arctic_a0250
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
arctic_a0251
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
arctic_a0252
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
arctic_a0253
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
arctic_a0254
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
arctic_a0255
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
arctic_a0256
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
arctic_a0257
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
arctic_a0258
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Think of investing in such an adventure.
arctic_a0259
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
arctic_a0260
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I have been doubly baptized.
arctic_a0261
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
arctic_a0262
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
arctic_a0263
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
arctic_a0264
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
arctic_a0265
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
arctic_a0266
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
arctic_a0267
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
arctic_a0268
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
arctic_a0269
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
arctic_a0270
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
arctic_a0271
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You can take a vacation on pay.
arctic_a0272
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They are big trees and require plenty of room.
arctic_a0273
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
arctic_a0274
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
arctic_a0275
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
arctic_a0276
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
arctic_a0277
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It would give me nervous prostration.
arctic_a0278
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She said with chattering teeth.
arctic_a0279
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
arctic_a0280
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
arctic_a0281
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
arctic_a0282
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
arctic_a0283
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
arctic_a0284
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
arctic_a0285
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
arctic_a0286
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Keep an eye on him.
arctic_a0287
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Those are my oysters, he said at last.
arctic_a0288
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
arctic_a0289
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## One by one the boys were captured.
arctic_a0290
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
arctic_a0291
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
arctic_a0292
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They were deep in the primeval forest.
arctic_a0293
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
arctic_a0294
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
arctic_a0295
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Bassett was a fastidious man.
arctic_a0296
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
arctic_a0297
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
arctic_a0298
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
arctic_a0299
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
arctic_a0300
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But all my dreams violated this law.
arctic_a0301
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
arctic_a0302
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
arctic_a0303
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I graduated last of my class.
arctic_a0304
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
arctic_a0305
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
arctic_a0306
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
arctic_a0307
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
arctic_a0308
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
arctic_a0309
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
arctic_a0310
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Therefore, hurrah for the game.
arctic_a0311
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
arctic_a0312
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
arctic_a0313
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
arctic_a0314
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
arctic_a0315
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
arctic_a0316
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was a wise hyena.
arctic_a0317
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
arctic_a0318
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
arctic_a0319
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
arctic_a0320
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
arctic_a0321
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This is a common experience with all of us.
arctic_a0322
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
arctic_a0323
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
arctic_a0324
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
arctic_a0325
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
arctic_a0326
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
arctic_a0327
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
arctic_a0328
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Ah, indeed.
arctic_a0329
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
arctic_a0330
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
arctic_a0331
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
arctic_a0332
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This is no place for you.
arctic_a0333
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
arctic_a0334
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
arctic_a0335
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
arctic_a0336
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
arctic_a0337
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The fighting had now become intermittent.
arctic_a0338
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
arctic_a0339
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was like the beating of hoofs.
arctic_a0340
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Why, doggone you all, shake again.
arctic_a0341
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
arctic_a0342
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
arctic_a0343
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
arctic_a0344
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
arctic_a0345
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Get down and dig in.
arctic_a0346
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
arctic_a0347
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
arctic_a0348
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
arctic_a0349
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
arctic_a0350
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was more like sugar.
arctic_a0351
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
arctic_a0352
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
arctic_a0353
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
arctic_a0354
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A burst of laughter was his reward.
arctic_a0355
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
arctic_a0356
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
arctic_a0357
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
arctic_a0358
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
arctic_a0359
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
arctic_a0360
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
arctic_a0361
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Nope, not the slightest idea.
arctic_a0362
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It is not an attempt to smash the market.
arctic_a0363
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
arctic_a0364
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## These rumors may even originate with us.
arctic_a0365
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
arctic_a0366
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
arctic_a0367
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
arctic_a0368
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
arctic_a0369
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He saw all men in the business game doing this.
arctic_a0370
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
arctic_a0371
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
arctic_a0372
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Points of view, new ideas, life.
arctic_a0373
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
arctic_a0374
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
arctic_a0375
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
arctic_a0376
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
arctic_a0377
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
arctic_a0378
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## How old are you, daddy.
arctic_a0379
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
arctic_a0380
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## My name's Ferguson.
arctic_a0381
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
arctic_a0382
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
arctic_a0383
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
arctic_a0384
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## That's what Carnegie did.
arctic_a0385
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I can't argue with you, and you know that.
arctic_a0386
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
arctic_a0387
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was my idea to a tee.
arctic_a0388
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Mab, she said.
arctic_a0389
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
arctic_a0390
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
arctic_a0391
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
arctic_a0392
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
arctic_a0393
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
arctic_a0394
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
arctic_a0395
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
arctic_a0396
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
arctic_a0397
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
arctic_a0398
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And here's another idea.
arctic_a0399
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Manuel had one besetting sin.
arctic_a0400
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
arctic_a0401
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
arctic_a0402
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
arctic_a0403
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
arctic_a0404
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
arctic_a0405
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
arctic_a0406
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
arctic_a0407
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
arctic_a0408
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He could feel a new stir in the land.
arctic_a0409
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
arctic_a0410
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
arctic_a0411
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
arctic_a0412
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But I am at the end of my resources.
arctic_a0413
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now our figuring was all right.
arctic_a0414
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
arctic_a0415
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
arctic_a0416
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
arctic_a0417
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
arctic_a0418
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.

## When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.

<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## By golly, the boy wins.
arctic_a0421
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
arctic_a0424
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
arctic_a0425
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They do not know the length of time of incubation.
arctic_a0426
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Enters now the psychology of the situation.
arctic_a0427
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was not exactly a deportation.
arctic_a0428
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
arctic_a0429
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
arctic_a0430
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
arctic_a0431
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The boy at the wheel lost his head.
arctic_a0432
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
arctic_a0433
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
arctic_a0434
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
arctic_a0435
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But Martin smiled a superior smile.
arctic_a0436
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
arctic_a0437
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
arctic_a0438
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
arctic_a0439
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Yes, sir, I corrected.
arctic_a0440
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
arctic_a0441
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You live on an income which your father earned.
arctic_a0442
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was worth nothing to the world.
arctic_a0443
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Then you don't believe in altruism.
arctic_a0444
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The creative joy, I murmured.
arctic_a0445
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
arctic_a0446
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
arctic_a0447
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
arctic_a0448
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
arctic_a0449
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
arctic_a0450
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
arctic_a0451
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
arctic_a0452
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
arctic_a0453
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
arctic_a0454
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
arctic_a0455
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
arctic_a0456
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## What I saw I could not at first believe.
arctic_a0457
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
arctic_a0458
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
arctic_a0459
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I had forgotten their existence.
arctic_a0460
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
arctic_a0461
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
arctic_a0462
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
arctic_a0463
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
arctic_a0464
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
arctic_a0465
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
arctic_a0466
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And so early in the voyage, too.
arctic_a0467
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
arctic_a0468
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
arctic_a0469
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He spat it out like so much venom.
arctic_a0470
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
arctic_a0471
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
arctic_a0472
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The night was calm and snowy.
arctic_a0473
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
arctic_a0474
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
arctic_a0475
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
arctic_a0476
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
arctic_a0477
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
arctic_a0478
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
arctic_a0479
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Tom Spink has a harpoon.
arctic_a0480
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
arctic_a0481
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
arctic_a0482
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
arctic_a0483
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## No-sir-ee.
arctic_a0484
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Each insult added to the value of the claim.
arctic_a0485
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
arctic_a0486
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
arctic_a0487
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Their love burned with increasing brightness.
arctic_a0488
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They were artists, not biologists.
arctic_a0489
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
arctic_a0490
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
arctic_a0491
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
arctic_a0492
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
arctic_a0493
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
arctic_a0494
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
arctic_a0495
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And Tom King patiently endured.
arctic_a0496
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## King took every advantage he knew.
arctic_a0497
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The lines were now very taut.
arctic_a0498
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And right there I saw and knew it all.
arctic_a0499
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
arctic_a0500
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
arctic_a0501
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
arctic_a0502
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
arctic_a0503
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was an athlete and a giant.
arctic_a0504
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We fished sharks on Niihau together.
arctic_a0505
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu.
arctic_a0506
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics.
arctic_a0507
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.
arctic_a0508
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked.
arctic_a0509
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.
arctic_a0510
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There is more behind this than a mere university ideal.
arctic_a0511
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.
arctic_a0512
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We must give ourselves and not our money alone.
arctic_a0513
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.
arctic_a0514
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.
arctic_a0515
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Also, there was awe in their faces.
arctic_a0516
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it.
arctic_a0517
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.
arctic_a0518
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land.
arctic_a0519
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem.
arctic_a0520
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Without them he could not run his empire.
arctic_a0521
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For such countries nothing remained but reorganization.
arctic_a0522
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.
arctic_a0523
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states.
arctic_a0524
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work.
arctic_a0525
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Nowhere did the raw earth appear.
arctic_a0526
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield.
arctic_a0527
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Men who endure it, call it living death.
arctic_a0528
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly.
arctic_a0529
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini.
arctic_a0530
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.
arctic_a0531
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## May drought destroy your crops.
arctic_a0532
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse.
arctic_a0533
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But Johannes could, and did.
arctic_a0534
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.
arctic_a0535
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He would destroy all things that are fixed.
arctic_a0536
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller.
arctic_a0537
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived.
arctic_a0538
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.
arctic_a0539
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
arctic_a0540
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Warden with a quart of champagne.
arctic_a0541
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements.
arctic_a0542
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.
arctic_a0543
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He may anticipate the day of his death.
arctic_a0544
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
arctic_a0545
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze.
arctic_a0546
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
arctic_a0547
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Also, churches and preachers I had never known.
arctic_a0548
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
arctic_a0549
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This also became part of the daily schedule.
arctic_a0550
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## All an appearance can know is mirage.
arctic_a0551
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.
arctic_a0552
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.
arctic_a0553
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu.
arctic_a0554
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.
arctic_a0555
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.
arctic_a0556
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The last refugee had passed.
arctic_a0557
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
arctic_a0558
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
arctic_a0559
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
arctic_a0560
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation.
arctic_a0561
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## What the flaming.
arctic_a0562
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap.
arctic_a0563
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality.
arctic_a0564
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## With them were Indians, also three other men.
arctic_a0565
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document.
arctic_a0566
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet.
arctic_a0567
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was just bursting with joy, joy over what.
arctic_a0568
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe.
arctic_a0569
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.
arctic_a0570
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out.
arctic_a0571
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I never saw anything like her in my life.
arctic_a0572
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves.
arctic_a0573
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Good business man, Curly, O'Brien was saying.
arctic_a0574
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There weren't any missions, and he was the man to know.
arctic_a0575
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers.
arctic_a0576
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless.
arctic_a0577
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But we'll just postpone this.
arctic_a0578
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was the Emma Louisa.
arctic_a0579
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This is my fifth voyage.
arctic_a0580
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind.
arctic_a0581
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along.
arctic_a0582
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Enjoy it he did, but principally for Steward's sake.
arctic_a0583
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I have long noted your thirst unquenchable.
arctic_a0584
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Wonder if he's a lion dog, Charles suggested.
arctic_a0585
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We don't see ourselves as foolish.
arctic_a0586
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had comparatively no advantages at first.
arctic_a0587
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions.
arctic_a0588
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was sick once -- typhoid.
arctic_a0589
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In a way he is my protege.
arctic_a0590
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We are both children together.
arctic_a0591
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It's only his indigestion I find fault with.
arctic_a0592
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She'd make a good wife for the cashier.
arctic_a0593
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Gad, do I remember it.
arctic_b0001
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl.
arctic_b0002
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I can see that knife now.
arctic_b0003
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die.
arctic_b0004
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's.
arctic_b0005
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door.
arctic_b0006
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill.
arctic_b0007
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile.
arctic_b0008
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap.
arctic_b0009
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger.
arctic_b0010
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face.
arctic_b0011
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him.
arctic_b0012
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them.
arctic_b0013
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout.
arctic_b0014
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They robbed me a few years later.
arctic_b0015
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it.
arctic_b0016
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected.
arctic_b0017
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was completely lost in my work.
arctic_b0018
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His slim hands gripped the edges of the table.
arctic_b0019
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue.
arctic_b0020
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip dropped back into his chair.
arctic_b0021
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## If I was out of the game it would be easily made.
arctic_b0022
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## MacDougall, my engineer, believes it.
arctic_b0023
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It is growing, every day, every hour.
arctic_b0024
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now, you understand.
arctic_b0025
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You have associated with some of these men.
arctic_b0026
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight.
arctic_b0027
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation.
arctic_b0028
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto.
arctic_b0029
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips.
arctic_b0030
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil.
arctic_b0031
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He caught himself with a jerk.
arctic_b0032
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## How does your wager look now.
arctic_b0033
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He confessed that the sketch had startled him.
arctic_b0034
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## After all, the picture was only a resemblance.
arctic_b0035
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He wondered, too, where Roscoe was.
arctic_b0036
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip knew that she was not an Indian.
arctic_b0037
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things.
arctic_b0038
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him.
arctic_b0039
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The thought set his blood tingling.
arctic_b0040
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow.
arctic_b0041
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief.
arctic_b0042
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It won't be for sale.
arctic_b0043
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For a few moments he ate in silence.
arctic_b0044
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip did not pursue the subject.
arctic_b0045
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him.
arctic_b0046
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Suppose you saw me at work through the window.
arctic_b0047
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two.
arctic_b0048
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words.
arctic_b0049
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## All this day Gregson remained in the cabin.
arctic_b0050
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson.
arctic_b0051
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The flush was gone from her face.
arctic_b0052
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed.
arctic_b0053
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He understood the meaning of the look.
arctic_b0054
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before.
arctic_b0055
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson.
arctic_b0056
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers.
arctic_b0057
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We must achieve our own salvation.
arctic_b0058
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In moments of mental energy Philip was restless.
arctic_b0059
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two.
arctic_b0060
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence.
arctic_b0061
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now it was missing from the wall.
arctic_b0062
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait.
arctic_b0063
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight.
arctic_b0064
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip.
arctic_b0065
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen.
arctic_b0066
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight.
arctic_b0067
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Only the chance sound had led him to observe them.
arctic_b0068
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre.
arctic_b0069
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was no chance to fire without hitting him.
arctic_b0070
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was no answer from the other side.
arctic_b0071
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him.
arctic_b0072
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone.
arctic_b0073
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive.
arctic_b0074
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution.
arctic_b0075
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him.
arctic_b0076
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It is the nearest refuge.
arctic_b0077
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice.
arctic_b0078
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The truth of it set Jeanne quivering.
arctic_b0079
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon.
arctic_b0080
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock.
arctic_b0081
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break.
arctic_b0082
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In it there was something that was almost tragedy.
arctic_b0083
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Your face is red with blood.
arctic_b0084
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank.
arctic_b0085
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He can care for himself.
arctic_b0086
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They will search for us between their camp and Churchill.
arctic_b0087
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Until I die, he exclaimed.
arctic_b0088
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils.
arctic_b0089
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed.
arctic_b0090
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking.
arctic_b0091
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I want to die in it.
arctic_b0092
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Darkness hid him from Jeanne.
arctic_b0093
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And yet if she came he had no words to say.
arctic_b0094
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day.
arctic_b0095
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Within himself he called it no longer his own.
arctic_b0096
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Besides, that noise makes me deaf.
arctic_b0097
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe.
arctic_b0098
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks.
arctic_b0099
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne.
arctic_b0100
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win.
arctic_b0101
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'll only be in the way.
arctic_b0102
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips.
arctic_b0103
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body.
arctic_b0104
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows.
arctic_b0105
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face.
arctic_b0106
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was sure, now, of but few things.
arctic_b0107
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was a miracle, and I owe you my life.
arctic_b0108
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him.
arctic_b0109
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Such men believe, when they come together.
arctic_b0110
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The journey was continued at dawn.
arctic_b0111
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock.
arctic_b0112
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now.
arctic_b0113
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He moved his position, and the illusion was gone.
arctic_b0114
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For two hours not a word passed between them.
arctic_b0115
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip.
arctic_b0116
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer.
arctic_b0117
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call.
arctic_b0118
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Billinger may arrive in time.
arctic_b0119
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette.
arctic_b0120
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I want my men to work by themselves.
arctic_b0121
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe.
arctic_b0122
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men.
arctic_b0123
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times.
arctic_b0124
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear.
arctic_b0125
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast.
arctic_b0126
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman.
arctic_b0127
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Philip bent low over Pierre.
arctic_b0128
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill.
arctic_b0129
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She saw the answer in his face.
arctic_b0130
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you.
arctic_b0131
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand.
arctic_b0132
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There followed a roar that shook the earth.
arctic_b0133
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Blind with rage, he darted in.
arctic_b0134
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In it was the joy of life.
arctic_b0135
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Swiftly his eyes measured the situation.
arctic_b0136
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But this little defect did not worry him.
arctic_b0137
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And then, steadily, he began to chew.
arctic_b0138
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Together they ate the rabbit.
arctic_b0139
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world.
arctic_b0140
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits.
arctic_b0141
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now.
arctic_b0142
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it.
arctic_b0143
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart.
arctic_b0144
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest.
arctic_b0145
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment.
arctic_b0146
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Had it struck squarely it would have killed him.
arctic_b0147
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce.
arctic_b0148
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur.
arctic_b0149
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.
arctic_b0150
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was steel, a fisher trap.
arctic_b0151
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## OW, a wild dog, he growled.
arctic_b0152
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home.
arctic_b0153
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## That is the strange part of it.
arctic_b0154
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor.
arctic_b0155
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight.
arctic_b0156
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle.
arctic_b0157
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms.
arctic_b0158
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His teeth shut with a last click.
arctic_b0159
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators.
arctic_b0160
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In a flash he was on his feet, facing him.
arctic_b0161
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders.
arctic_b0162
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The moon had already begun its westward decline.
arctic_b0163
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They laughed like two happy children.
arctic_b0164
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back.
arctic_b0165
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Fast, but endure.
arctic_b0166
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came.
arctic_b0167
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart.
arctic_b0168
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them.
arctic_b0169
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Then he shouted, Shut up.
arctic_b0170
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair.
arctic_b0171
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded.
arctic_b0172
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## To these he gave castor oil.
arctic_b0173
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing.
arctic_b0174
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Sheldon glanced at the thermometer.
arctic_b0175
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'll see to poor Hughie.
arctic_b0176
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering.
arctic_b0177
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Also, I want information.
arctic_b0178
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Let them go out and eat with my boys.
arctic_b0179
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I, I beg pardon, he drawled.
arctic_b0180
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt.
arctic_b0181
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was in New York when the crash came.
arctic_b0182
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## No, I did not fall among thieves.
arctic_b0183
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips.
arctic_b0184
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me.
arctic_b0185
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I can't go elsewhere, by your own account.
arctic_b0186
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation.
arctic_b0187
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips.
arctic_b0188
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals.
arctic_b0189
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.
arctic_b0190
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons.
arctic_b0191
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged.
arctic_b0192
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## So was Packard's finish suicide.
arctic_b0193
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Joan cried, with shining eyes.
arctic_b0194
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Nobody knows how the natives got them.
arctic_b0195
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## How can you manage all alone, Mr Young.
arctic_b0196
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The planters are already considering the matter.
arctic_b0197
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I use great trouble advisedly.
arctic_b0198
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time.
arctic_b0199
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We leave the eventuality to time and law.
arctic_b0200
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe.
arctic_b0201
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Society is shaken to its foundations.
arctic_b0202
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A month in Australia would finish me.
arctic_b0203
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods.
arctic_b0204
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You were destroying my life.
arctic_b0205
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery.
arctic_b0206
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'm as good as a man, she urged.
arctic_b0207
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You read the quotations in today's paper.
arctic_b0208
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He's terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them.
arctic_b0209
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi.
arctic_b0210
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This is eighteen eighty.
arctic_b0211
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Death is and has been ever since old Maui died.
arctic_b0212
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Some boy, she laughed acquiescence.
arctic_b0213
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Let us talk it over and find a way out.
arctic_b0214
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It is a good property, and worth more than that.
arctic_b0215
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted.
arctic_b0216
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Such is my passage engaged on the steamer.
arctic_b0217
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The issue was not in doubt.
arctic_b0218
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all.
arctic_b0219
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Harry Bancroft, Dave lied.
arctic_b0220
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It's a Yankee, Joan cried.
arctic_b0221
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant.
arctic_b0222
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They likewise are disinclined to being eaten.
arctic_b0223
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta.
arctic_b0224
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The President of the United States was his friend.
arctic_b0225
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Your face was the personification of duplicity.
arctic_b0226
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Shorty turned to their employers.
arctic_b0227
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You were engaged.
arctic_b0228
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I saw it all myself, and it was splendid.
arctic_b0229
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now run along, and tell them to hurry.
arctic_b0230
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## What's that grub-thief got to do with it.
arctic_b0231
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was a superb picture.
arctic_b0232
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## So she said, the irate skipper dashed on.
arctic_b0233
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice.
arctic_b0234
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard.
arctic_b0235
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land.
arctic_b0236
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They just lay off in the bush and plugged away.
arctic_b0237
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating.
arctic_b0238
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And there was a dog that barked.
arctic_b0239
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There are four, all low, McCoy answered.
arctic_b0240
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley.
arctic_b0241
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand.
arctic_b0242
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They had been on the same lay as ourselves.
arctic_b0243
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You are positively soulless, he said savagely.
arctic_b0244
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Harrison is still my chauffeur.
arctic_b0245
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The boy grew and prospered.
arctic_b0246
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone.
arctic_b0247
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol.
arctic_b0248
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I know they are my oysters.
arctic_b0249
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek.
arctic_b0250
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents.
arctic_b0251
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne.
arctic_b0252
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds.
arctic_b0253
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders.
arctic_b0254
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him.
arctic_b0255
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect.
arctic_b0256
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust.
arctic_b0257
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You fired me out of your house, in short.
arctic_b0258
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh.
arctic_b0259
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It's worth eight dollars.
arctic_b0260
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And he did hurt my arm.
arctic_b0261
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Saxon's onto her job.
arctic_b0262
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another.
arctic_b0263
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But this time it was Saxon who rebelled.
arctic_b0264
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was not to cry out in the face of fear.
arctic_b0265
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And now put yourself in my place for a moment.
arctic_b0266
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The boy threw back his head with pride.
arctic_b0267
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned.
arctic_b0268
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot.
arctic_b0269
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We could throw stones with our feet.
arctic_b0270
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way.
arctic_b0271
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter.
arctic_b0272
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Then it was that a strange thing happened.
arctic_b0273
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## From the source of light a harsh voice said.
arctic_b0274
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But I did not enjoy it long.
arctic_b0275
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We were now good friends.
arctic_b0276
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Two of the Folk were already up.
arctic_b0277
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now animals do not like mockery.
arctic_b0278
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees.
arctic_b0279
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried.
arctic_b0280
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion.
arctic_b0281
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured.
arctic_b0282
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But we were without this momentum.
arctic_b0283
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was one difficulty, however.
arctic_b0284
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The hyena proceeded to dine.
arctic_b0285
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The time was considered auspicious.
arctic_b0286
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Or have they already devised one.
arctic_b0287
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We would not spend another such night.
arctic_b0288
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At first his progress was slow and erratic.
arctic_b0289
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated.
arctic_b0290
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The awe of man rushed over him again.
arctic_b0291
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders.
arctic_b0292
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities.
arctic_b0293
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## For a much longer time Lop-Ear and I remained and watched.
arctic_b0294
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret.
arctic_b0295
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style.
arctic_b0296
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round.
arctic_b0297
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-Leg by the neck.
arctic_b0298
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Miss Brodie's smile was slightly sarcastic.
arctic_b0299
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way.
arctic_b0300
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A flying arrow passed between us.
arctic_b0301
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I pulled, suddenly, with all my might.
arctic_b0302
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Here we allow our solicitors to look after our legal work.
arctic_b0303
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children.
arctic_b0304
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp.
arctic_b0305
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers.
arctic_b0306
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish eaters.
arctic_b0307
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We never made another migration.
arctic_b0308
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Nor was Elam Harnish an exception.
arctic_b0309
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A little treatment, massage, with some help from the doctor.
arctic_b0310
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The 29th very foggy.
arctic_b0311
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Dig in; you're sure good, was Daylight's answer.
arctic_b0312
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The apron string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt.
arctic_b0313
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had been born with this endowment.
arctic_b0314
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal.
arctic_b0315
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun.
arctic_b0316
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury.
arctic_b0317
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Again he had done the big thing.
arctic_b0318
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Daylight was tired, profoundly tired.
arctic_b0319
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter.
arctic_b0320
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day.
arctic_b0321
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Their supply of grub was gone.
arctic_b0322
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead.
arctic_b0323
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Not till the twentieth of May did the river break.
arctic_b0324
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was a gigantic inadequacy.
arctic_b0325
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel.
arctic_b0326
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had been so easy.
arctic_b0327
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Change chairs, Daylight commanded.
arctic_b0328
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I'd sooner have my chips back.
arctic_b0329
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They only had a little thirty thousand dollar fire.
arctic_b0330
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His partners had starved and died on the Stewart.
arctic_b0331
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all.
arctic_b0332
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It does, was her audacious answer.
arctic_b0333
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Oh, it's just a novel, a love story.
arctic_b0334
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Whoever lived on the ranch did that.
arctic_b0335
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## How old are you, mother.
arctic_b0336
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Here he got a fresh thrill.
arctic_b0337
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was unobtrusive, yet it was there.
arctic_b0338
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned.
arctic_b0339
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him.
arctic_b0340
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I play that choice wide open to win.
arctic_b0341
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up.
arctic_b0342
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But how are you going to do it.
arctic_b0343
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Lots of men take women buggy riding.
arctic_b0344
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him.
arctic_b0345
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There's not an iota of truth in it.
arctic_b0346
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano.
arctic_b0347
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me.
arctic_b0348
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell.
arctic_b0349
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest.
arctic_b0350
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Matthewson, who's this bookkeeper, Rogers.
arctic_b0351
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Now just what do you want to know.
arctic_b0352
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I want to know how all this is possible.
arctic_b0353
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It's that much junk.
arctic_b0354
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed.
arctic_b0355
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He loved to play Chinese lottery.
arctic_b0356
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Law of Club and Fang
arctic_b0357
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip.
arctic_b0358
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And as never before, he was ready to obey.
arctic_b0359
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This state of mind comes of an undue prominence of the ego.
arctic_b0360
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There are the canals of China, and the Yang-tse River.
arctic_b0361
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed.
arctic_b0362
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She was built primarily to sail.
arctic_b0363
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## In the Bohemian Club of San Francisco there are some crack sailors.
arctic_b0364
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## My age, in years, is twenty two.
arctic_b0365
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I forgot how easily I had taught myself from the printed page.
arctic_b0366
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Any average young fellow can teach himself in a week.
arctic_b0367
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Please do not think that I already know it all.
arctic_b0368
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You see, we were teaching ourselves.
arctic_b0369
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And now behold the perversity of things.
arctic_b0370
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you.
arctic_b0371
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Mr McVeigh told me about him.
arctic_b0372
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Unlike Joshua, he stood in no need of divine assistance.
arctic_b0373
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## To say the least, Captain Cook was a rather thorough going empiricist.
arctic_b0374
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Man could not conquer them.
arctic_b0375
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Thought I, and a worthy fool he proved.
arctic_b0376
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A scarlet loincloth completed his costume.
arctic_b0377
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I like to speculate upon the glorious future of man.
arctic_b0378
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Christmas is an easy problem compared with a Polynesian giving-feast.
arctic_b0379
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it.
arctic_b0380
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And how would we ever find ourselves.
arctic_b0381
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I defy any man to get a Solomon Island sore in California.
arctic_b0382
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## A bush chief had died a natural death.
arctic_b0383
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The skipper's and Nakata's gymnastics served as a translation without words.
arctic_b0384
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia.
arctic_b0385
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives.
arctic_b0386
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It is merely the simple superlative.
arctic_b0387
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I made no more overtures.
arctic_b0388
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Among my minor afflictions, I may mention a new and mysterious one.
arctic_b0389
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The voyage was our idea of a good time.
arctic_b0390
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At sea, Tuesday, March 17, 1908.
arctic_b0391
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Yes, sir, he answered, with cheerful alacrity.
arctic_b0392
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was still weak from my prolonged immersion.
arctic_b0393
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper.
arctic_b0394
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I was beneath the water, suffocating and drowning.
arctic_b0395
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing.
arctic_b0396
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed.
arctic_b0397
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I have been robbed, sir, I amended.
arctic_b0398
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You were looking squeamish this afternoon, he began.
arctic_b0399
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment.
arctic_b0400
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I learned it myself in English ships.
arctic_b0401
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others.
arctic_b0402
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding.
arctic_b0403
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Yes, and no, sir, was the slow reply.
arctic_b0404
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And each year something happened, and I did not go.
arctic_b0405
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## How in hell did he know it was you in the dark.
arctic_b0406
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually occurring.
arctic_b0407
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You have all the advantage.
arctic_b0408
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip.
arctic_b0409
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labour.
arctic_b0410
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough.
arctic_b0411
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Ah, it was sweet in my ears.
arctic_b0412
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He may desire to escape pain, or to enjoy pleasure.
arctic_b0413
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore.
arctic_b0414
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean.
arctic_b0415
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I arose obediently and went down the beach.
arctic_b0416
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The next thing to watch out for is bed sores.
arctic_b0417
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## At that moment I got the impression that she was willowy.
arctic_b0418
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Your father's fifth command, he nodded.
arctic_b0419
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## On occasion, on this traverse, the Cape Verde Islands are raised.
arctic_b0420
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## She is essentially the life-giving, life-conserving female of the species.
arctic_b0421
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## This was when the explosion occurred.
arctic_b0422
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Also, at regular intervals, he would mutter.
arctic_b0423
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## It is a very tenable hypothesis, and will bear looking into.
arctic_b0424
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There were orange-green, gold-green, and a copper-green.
arctic_b0425
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The Gabriel voice of the Samurai rang out.
arctic_b0426
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast of the Argentine.
arctic_b0427
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The history of our westward-faring race is written in it.
arctic_b0428
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And the Eurasian Chinese-Englishman bowed himself away.
arctic_b0429
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They were babbling and chattering all together.
arctic_b0430
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Too much, he told me, with ominous rolling head.
arctic_b0431
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He is a candidate, rising from the serf class to our class.
arctic_b0432
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## We are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners.
arctic_b0433
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice.
arctic_b0434
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Well, did they eat.
arctic_b0435
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Famine had been my great ally.
arctic_b0436
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Nowhere in the North is the soil so prolific.
arctic_b0437
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank.
arctic_b0438
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## The land exchanged its austere robes for the garb of a smiling wanton.
arctic_b0439
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## There were stir and bustle, new faces, and fresh facts.
arctic_b0440
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## And there was Ethel Baird, whom also you must remember.
arctic_b0441
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He had become a man very early in life.
arctic_b0442
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## I did not think you would be so early.
arctic_b0443
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He did not know what went on in the minds of his superiors.
arctic_b0444
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Mops, sir, eagerly answered the sailor at the wheel.
arctic_b0445
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Some one had thrust a large sheath-knife into his hand.
arctic_b0446
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## O'Brien emitted a shriek that sank swiftly to a gurgling sob.
arctic_b0447
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Sandel would never become a world champion.
arctic_b0448
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Also, she wouldn't walk.
arctic_b0449
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## To my dearest and always appreciated friend, I submit myself.
arctic_b0450
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## You used to joyride like the very devil.
arctic_b0451
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## They saw each other for the first time in Boston.
arctic_b0452
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Isaac Ford, the austere soldier of the Lord, the old hypocrite.
arctic_b0453
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## Eighteen, he added.
arctic_b0454
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## His reward should have been peace and repose.
arctic_b0455
<audio data-autoplay src='beep.mp3'></audio>

## He was an amphibian and a mountaineer.
